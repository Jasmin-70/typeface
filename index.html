<p id="paragraph2">TT Modernoir was designed by Antonia Zhulkora and Toma Streltsova for the TypeType Foundry. It was debuted by Myfonts in 2024. It is a san serif with dynamic proportions and inspired by art nouveau forms and is also inspired by French typography and film noir. It also references art deco design movements and the improvisational freedom and rhythm of jazz music in the 20th century. Its purpose is to provide a sophisticated display of font titles and headings for branding, posters, and magazine covers. The typeface contains fluid lines and swirls that give a sense of movement while incorporating shapes and style from the art nouveau period. Some of the legs of certain letters feature curves which add to its uniqueness.

<p id="paragraph3">On July 17, 2025, TT Modernoir was updated with new lowercase letters,  new glyphs, numeral and currency symbols for the minuscule and minuscule tabular figures. This new update expands the typeface’s functionality because before it was known for its uppercase forms and was used as a title font. The typeface includes 6 font styles: 5 roman and one variable font. It also includes 1339 characters in each font style and 230+ language supports.</p>
